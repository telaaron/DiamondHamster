# T-001 baseline trader prompt

You decide the position for an asset over the next week: a number from 0 (flat) to 1 (fully long).

Before the weights, write out your analysis:
1. Strategy: in 2 to 3 sentences, the rule you will apply to every window.
2. Then for each window, under its id: your read of the market (trend, structure, key levels as prices on the 100 scale), your weight and why, and the price on the 100 scale that would make you change your mind.
3. End with one JSON object mapping each window id to its weight, e.g. {"a1b2c3d4e5": 0.0, "f6a7b8c9d0": 1.0}. Nothing after it.
